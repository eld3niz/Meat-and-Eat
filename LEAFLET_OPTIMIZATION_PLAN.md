# Leaflet Map Optimization & Redesign Plan (Performance Prioritized)

This plan outlines the steps to address performance bottlenecks and enhance the design of the Leaflet map page, with an initial focus on resolving performance issues.

## Phase 1: Performance Diagnosis & Optimization (Priority)

The primary goal of this phase is to identify and resolve the root causes of slow performance, particularly during zoom operations.

1.  **Diagnose Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Method:** Utilize Browser Developer Tools (Network, Performance, Console tabs) while interacting with the map, specifically zooming in and out.
    *   **Areas to Investigate:**
        *   **Network:** Slow tile loading times? Large GeoJSON file downloads? Frequent/large API requests?
        *   **Performance:** Profile JavaScript execution. Identify long-running tasks, high CPU usage. Pinpoint slow functions related to:
            *   Marker rendering/management
            *   GeoJSON parsing/processing
            *   Custom layer logic
            *   Map event handlers (`zoomend`, `moveend`)
        *   **Console:** Check for errors or warnings logged during interaction.
    *   **Goal:** Clearly identify the primary performance bottleneck(s).

2.  **Implement Targeted Optimizations:**
    *   Based on the diagnosis, implement one or more of the following strategies:
        *   **If Too Many Markers:**
            *   Implement marker clustering (e.g., `Leaflet.markercluster`).
            *   Consider Canvas-based marker rendering for very large datasets.
        *   **If Large/Complex GeoJSON Data:**
            *   Switch to **Vector Tiles** (Recommended for scalability). Requires a tile source (self-hosted or third-party).
            *   Implement a **Server-Side Filtering API** to load data dynamically based on map bounds/zoom.
            *   Ensure **Asynchronous Loading/Parsing** (use `fetch`, consider Web Workers for parsing).
            *   Implement **Data Simplification/Generalization** (e.g., using `turf.js` server-side) for vector data at lower zoom levels.
        *   **If Inefficient Custom Code:**
            *   **Optimize** the specific JavaScript functions identified during profiling.
            *   Apply **Debouncing/Throttling** to expensive event handlers (especially for `move` or `zoom` events).
        *   **If Slow Tile Layers:**
            *   Evaluate the performance/reliability of the current **Tile Server**.
            *   Consider switching to a different provider or a premium plan.
            *   Ensure correct usage of `maxNativeZoom`.
    *   **Goal:** Apply the most effective optimization(s) for the identified bottleneck.

3.  **Test & Verify:**
    *   Rigorously test map performance after implementing optimizations.
    *   Use the Performance tab again to measure improvements.
    *   Confirm that zoom operations are significantly smoother and faster.
    *   **Goal:** Validate the effectiveness of the applied optimizations.

## Phase 2: Design Enhancement (Deferred)

This phase will commence once performance issues are satisfactorily resolved.

1.  **Base Map Selection/Styling:** Choose and configure a visually appealing base map.
2.  **Marker Redesign:** Implement custom SVG markers with appropriate styling.
3.  **Popup Styling:** Customize popup appearance using CSS to match the application UI.
4.  **Control Styling & Placement:** Style map controls and ensure logical placement.
5.  **Overall UI Integration:** Ensure the map blends seamlessly with the application.
