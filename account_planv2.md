mplementation Plan: Account Creation and Management with Supabase
Supabase Project Setup: Create a new Supabase project at https://supabase.com/. Obtain the Supabase API URL and the API key (anon key).
Install Supabase Client: Install the Supabase client library in your React project: npm install @supabase/supabase-js.
Initialize Supabase Client: Create a file src/utils/supabaseClient.ts to initialize the Supabase client, using the API URL and key from step 1. Ensure you set the environment variables NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
Create a profiles Table in Supabase: Define a table named profiles in your Supabase database with columns for id (UUID, primary key, references auth.users), name (text), age (integer), languages (array of text), and cuisines (array of text).
Modify handleSubmit in MultiStepRegisterForm.tsx:
Import the Supabase client.
Get the form data (email, password, name, age, languages, cuisines).
Use supabase.auth.signUp to create a new user with the email and password.
Handle potential signup errors (e.g., display an error message).
Upon successful signup, get the user's ID from the authData.
Insert the additional user data (name, age, languages, cuisines) into the profiles table, linking it to the user's ID.
Handle potential profile insertion errors.
Display a success message or redirect the user upon successful signup and profile creation.
Modify handleSubmit in LoginForm.tsx:
Import the Supabase client.
Get the email and password from the form.
Use supabase.auth.signInWithPassword to sign in the user.
Handle potential login errors (e.g., display an error message).
Upon successful login, handle the user session (e.g., store the session data, redirect to a logged-in area).
Implement User Session Management: After successful login/signup, store the user's session (token) securely (e.g., using local storage or cookies). Implement a mechanism to check for an active session on page load and redirect the user accordingly.
Implement Logout Functionality: Add a logout button/link that calls supabase.auth.signOut to clear the user's session.
Implement Error Handling: Add error handling to both signup and login forms to display user-friendly error messages.
Testing: Test the signup and login functionality thoroughly, including error cases and different user inputs.
